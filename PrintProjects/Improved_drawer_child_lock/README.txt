# Summary

Simple drawer lock designed to keep very curious little people out. Designed for an IKEA MALM chest of drawers, but it will likely fit other drawers with wood-based side walls (although if you're feeling adventurous and try to use this on a metal drawer, I'd be happy to hear about this).

Even though I've installed drawer locks (ikea patrull and [my clone](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3510507)) in the clothes drawers, my 2yo still manages to make a mess by pulling out clothes through the small gap which is needed for the patrull-type lock.

The old lock has the fixed part attached to the front of the drawer, while the flexible arm is deeper inside the drawer. This requires the user to reach deeper into the drawer in order to unlock it, so the drawer needs to extend considerably before being unlocked.

This is a redesign of the lock, focused on minimizing the "locked" drawer extension. The fixed attachment point was moved deeper into the drawer, while the flexible arm extends towards the front. When attached properly, the locked drawer will extend by only ~15mm (or however large your finger is), which is enough to operate the lock. 

The downside of this solution is that the lock requires considerably less force to operate. Don't tell my daughter :)

The lock is designed for installation on the left side of the drawer. A mirrored copy will fit the right

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK2S
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm

Notes: 
None of the settings are critical. More infill will likely increase the required actuation force.

## Installation

The part needs to be attached on the outside of the left drawer wall, that is, it will remain between the drawer and the cabinet walls when the drawer is closed. The arm should be almost horizontal, maybe with a slight upward slope. The tip should almost reach the front of the drawer.

A small bolt (I recommend a short wood screw) needs to be inserted on the inside of the left wall of the cabinet. The screw needs to be positioned just above the arm, so that it's caught by the "finger" when the drawer is opened (red dot on the picture). The distance from the front of the cabinet will determine the maximum extension for the locked drawer.

When the arm is pushed down, the finger will bypass the screw and allow the drawer to open fully. When the drawer is closed, the screw will force the arm down for automatic re-locking. 

The tricky part is that you will most likely need to place the screw with the drawer removed, so it's not easy to find the right place. If you figure out an easy way to do it, please comment :)


Recommended installation order:
1. Attach the arm with the lower screw.
2. Insert the locking screw on the cabinet wall.
3. Adjust position of the arm, if necessary, and fix it by inserting the upper screw.

If the instructions aren't clear enough, feel free to ask in the comments.

# How I Designed This

This is my first real attempt at using FreeCAD. So far, my experience is overwhelmingly mixed :) The 2D solver is really nice to work with, however everything breaks down when going beyond one sketch, *especially* when modifying a sketch on which something else was based already. Is there a better way?
