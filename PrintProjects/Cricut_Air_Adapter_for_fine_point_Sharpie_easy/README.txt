# Summary

Quick easy print to adapt a fine point sharpie into a Cricut air, a few others out there but thought i would try to make an easy to print one, only takes about ~10min.

I had some difficulty getting the inside diameter right, it need to be 10.7mm, but when I made it with that size, it ended up being 10.4mm, which is to small. I'm using a 0.4mm nozzle, so that might have something to do with it, as the outside is 14mm and it came out right.

v2 has F. SHARPIE on the side, i have made a few now.. figure I'd write a name on the side.
