# Summary

Aloha, There clips are modded from the Ender 3 glass bed clips by ccrowder5 https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3359256 , 
I modified these clips to have a thicker back end as to keep them from snapping when sliping it on to the heatbed and glass top, Its made for a 4mm glass and increased in size and gap to fit an Ender 5 printer bed, i use a total of 6 of them to keep the glass in place as well as Hairspray on the back of the glass where it meets heat plate, since the Ender 5 bed only moves up and down very slowly the clips do well to keep the Glass bed pressed close to the heat bed and to keep it level. After many heating sessions and prints the clips are still doing well for me.

One issue is with the bed height and you will need to aquire a longer Z-axis stop screw as the one supplied to the Z-axis frame is to small to accomadate the new bed height and will hit the nozzle even with the screw springs Depressed
fully.

As previous creator of the clip recommends, to print in ABS for stronger hold which i will eventually get to, but at
65c using hatchbox PLA its still holding well for me.

Hope it helps someone!
