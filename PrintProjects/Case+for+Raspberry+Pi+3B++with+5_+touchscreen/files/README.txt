Summary
I made this case to house my Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 5 inch Touchscreen that I purchased from Jaycar here in New Zealand. Using it for OctoPrint with TouchUI.

NOTE: This case will not fit the Raspberry Pi 4. The Pi 4 has the Ethernet port and USB in different positions as well as having 2x micro HDMI ports as opposed to a single full size HDMI port.

There are several options for the case. They are:

Front with Power Button hole, Power & SD Activity LED's
Front with Power Button hole only
Front with Power & SD Activity LED's only
Front with No Power Button or LED's
Rear with Mount holes, PiCam ribbon slot & 30mm fan
Rear with PiCam ribbon slot and 30mm fan only

Fan used:

Push button on the bottom for quick safe shutdown of Pi before removing power.
This is the button I used in my case but there are plenty of other options out there.

3mm Green and Red LED's were used with a 220â„¦ resistor on each for the Power and SD Activity light. They glow through a thin section of the left wall.

Some things to note:

I rotated the display orientation on my display 180 degrees so that the Micro USB ports point down. Additionally I had to invert X and Y on the touchscreen so the touch worked correctly.

M3x12mm machine screws were used for holding the back cover on. The holes are printed undersized.
Holes in the front of case are 16mm deep.
Drill out to 2.5mm, then either cut the thread with the screws or use a 3mm tap.
Don't use a drill to run the tap in and out or you might strip out the threads. Alternatively you can use self tapping screws of similar size. I leave that up to you.

If you are using the mount and stand, be sure any screws you use to fix the mount onto the back of the case do not come in contact with connections on your raspberry pi.
Again I used M3x12mm machine screws with nuts on the inside. If you use longer, you may have to cut them shorter to avoid shorting the connections on your RasPi.

M5x25mm screw and wing nut used for locking the screen onto the stand. This allows for easy adjustment of the screen angle.

I'll be changing the fan to a 40mm 5v Noctua fan when it arrives and will upload a 40mm version of the back once i've tested it for fit and finish. 30mm fan works great for cooling in the case, just a little noisy.
Happy to make modifications and upload on request if you don't have the ability to do so yourself.

Notes:
Had a couple of issues with one of the rounded corners of the front part of the case curving up on the glass bed. Try printing with a brim to minimize this.

Recommend printing the mount and stand with additional walls and higher infill to prevent something breaking if you do the wing nut up too tight. I think I used 5 or 6 walls and 50% Cubic infill
