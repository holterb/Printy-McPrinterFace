# Summary

This is a universal adapter to allow on to attach a hose to the DC59 Animal vacuum from dyson.  I made this several years ago and decided to post it.  It has worked wonders to allow for much more flexibility.  Remix to tweak the end diameter if you want to attach a different sized hose or attachment on the end.

you should be able to copy this into your own workspace and spin the design as needed.  let me know if you have issues with this.
