# Summary

Additional electronics box for a Creality Ender 5 with room for a Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 mosfets. Based on measurements I made from my own Ender 5. I'm not sure what the variations are between different printers of this model, but it is a nice and snug fit on mine. doesn't even strictly need the bolts and hammer nuts to keep it in place. Step file is included if you need to make changes.

This is still a work in progress and mostly an exercise for myself to learn 3D modelling. The lid currently cannot be fixed to the box for example. And the fusion file is a total mess ;)

But still, it might be useful to someone.
