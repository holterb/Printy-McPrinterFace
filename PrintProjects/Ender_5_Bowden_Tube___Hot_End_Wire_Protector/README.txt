# Summary

I designed these protectors to protect the bowden tube and hot end wires from constantly rubbing on the allen heads that bolt the frame together. I have the tube and wires wrapped in polyethylene spiral wrap but wanted a little more protection. I have 3 designs here, so pick the one you think will work best for you. I prefer and use the V3 myself and it is pictured. Any of them will work and do a great job at keeping the tube/wires from catching and rubbing on the allen bolt heads. I would probably print them all together to see which you prefer. You can use the factory M5's that are already there. I added a couple of flat washers under the lock washers for a better seat on the bracket. Without them the bolt tries to pull through the hole.
