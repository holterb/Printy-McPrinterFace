# Summary

I wanted to have my pliers up on edge so they could  better fit in my toolbox, and after looking at commercial options such as http://www.amazon.ca/Lisle-40460-Black-Pliers-Wrench/dp/B00AC60ZZ2/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1456501385&sr=8-3-fkmr1&keywords=lisle+wrench+organizer I decided to create this.

The issue with the linked item is that if you have pliers with large grips like I do, only the 3 bigger slots will work, the others are too narrow.

I measured my 20+ pairs of pliers and attempted to create something that would work for most of them.  The only pairs I cant accommodate are angled needle nose pliers, as they just dont like to be stood on edge no matter what I do.


I've included the solidworks files if you want to adjust the widths of the slots to work with your tools.

I will update this shortly with a photo of it in action.
