Universal CD-car slot PHONE holder, mount. iPhone5, iPhone6 etc. Quick change!  by BerniApple is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial license.

# Summary

An universal cd-car phone holder. I designed it in order to change quickly the cradle from iPhone 5 to iPhone 6. You can create your own phone cradle and attach with glue the "Plate.stl" behind it.  

***Update 23 Feb 2016:***  
Support2.0 is out! 
• Better design, less plastic, less printing time
• Better architecture, now it's easier to slide the cradle in place

***Update 22 Sept 2015:***  
Now the "Support.stl" touch the build plate and it's easier to print.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: Prusa i3 Rework
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 100

# Instructions

*** I suggest printing it in ABS because exposed to the sun can melt ***  
However, you can use PLA for both Support2.0 and Cradle and remember to remove the Cradle from the sun.

You need:
• 1 x Support.stl
• As many Plates as Phone's cradles

Just glue in place the **"Plate.stl"** behind the iPhone5, iPhone6 or your own cradle.  
I suggest printing the **"Support2.0.stl"** at 100% infill  
Enjoy!
