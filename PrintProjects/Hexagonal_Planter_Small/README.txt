# Summary

This small planter is perfect for succulents and other small plants.  Use it to brighten up a dreary desk or to add a nice touch to the table setting.

It features a designed drainage holes, intelligent design to minimize the amount of required dirt, and a base to catch the drained water. Both the pot and base are 3D printed in-house with PLA plastic. The pot is opaque white. The base is made of wood-infused plastic, hand-sanded, stained, and then sealed to be waterproof.

Intended for indoor use only.

6 corners of the base have platforms to rest.  This prevents the pot from slipping down into the base.
Changed some angles and fillets on the pot to make it look better
