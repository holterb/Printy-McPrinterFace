# Summary

Why is it we only see improvements for things after they are installed or mounted?  I must have installed and removed a recent VESA mount RasPi case 10+ times.  That was my inspiration for this bracket.  

This was designed for my <a Href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2138134">Hitman Raspberry Pi Case</a> but should work with any 75mm VESA mounted device.  With the obvious exception of weight.  Please don't try to hang a monitor with this bracket.

My goal when designing this was to be able to print it in PLA without any support, and have it work right off the printer.  I hit both those goals with the exception of a couple small cuts needed by an exacto knife.  I included some tiny supports into the design of the feet holding tabs, in order for them to work properly the little supports have to be cut (see picture).

On previous designs, the holding tabs kept breaking on me - this design seems to be solid.  If you experience tabs breaking, you may try another PLA or switch to ABS or PET.

There are 2 bases included.  The first one I designed for a #6 flat screw as I am mounting it to wood.  I also included a base for M4 Flat screws so this could be mounted to the back of a monitor ( I have not tested the M4 yet ).

The feet will accommodate up to a Flat M4 screw.
