# Summary

This 3d print and woodworking project was created as a 90th birthday gift for my father.  

I have published a three-part series on YouTube explaining how I designed, fabricated and assembled the Lithophane birthday gift:

Part One - https://youtu.be/j1sYVJjAWyM
Part Two - https://youtu.be/ZCB_XITecpc
Part Three - https://youtu.be/OGat7BQAOxw

This build demonstrates the value of using the right technology and material for the job at hand.   Printing the base, which is in wood, would have been very time consuming and may have created stability problems since it needed to have sufficient weight to support the model properly.  

On the other hand 3d printing is ideal for the lithophane, the numbers, and the top frame.

The excellent http://3dp.rocks/lithophane/ website was used to create the lithophane stl file.   Fusion 360 was used to create the 3d printed top frame and numbers.

To speed up the print I used both my Prusa i3 MK3 and my Creality Ender 5 for the prints.

The components we glued together with a bit of superglue and attached to the wood base with hot glue.

The image I started with was 3539 x 1179 pixels.   I set the 3dp rocks lithophane model settings to maximum size of 230, thickness 4, border 4, thinnest layer 0.8, wectors 4, base 10 and selected the outer curve model.

The lithophane was printed in prusa white pla.

I substituted a DRVAX Youtube channel logo for my family photos as an example of the lithophane stl.




# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK3

Supports: No
Resolution: 15mm
Infill: 50%
Filament_brand: Hatchbox and Sunlu
Filament_color: Black
Filament_material: Hatchbox PLA and Sunlu PETG

Notes: 
The light used is a USB powered light bulb that I purchase on Amazon.  It is listed as the "Tytan [2-Pack Kobra USB LED Light Bulbs Camping, Emergency Night Light - 5W, 40" Wire".

The mazimum temperature when the light is on, measured at the top of the frame, is about 90 F.  I used PETG for the top to ensure it stays solid at this temperature.   PLA with a glass transition temperature of 60c (140f) should be fine, but I used PETG just to play it safe.
