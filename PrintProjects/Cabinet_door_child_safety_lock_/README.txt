# Summary

I've seen a picture of this design on the internet, but I couldn't find an STL file that someone had already made, so I made my own. This lock seems to work the best of all my attempted designs. It has two 5mm holes that are used to mount it to the door. I know I should have created a receiving end, and I'll probably add one later, but for now this is it. 

*** update*** 
I've added two types or receiving ends. One has a little lip for alignment purposes and the other doesn't incase it's in the way.
