# Summary

7 different versions of small parts bins for the Stanley 014725 25-Removable Compartment Professional Organizer. These storage cases are available on Amazon.  

These portable cases are similar to the Harbor Freight storage cases for which I posted similar bins (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:569241). The Stanley bins are 6mm shorter in height and the cases have a more durable lid compared to the Harbor Freight versions.   

Stanley does sell extra bins here http://www.stanleytoolparts.com/stpror.html. I wanted bins with smaller compartments to store resistors/capacitors/etc. And of course you can print in different colors instead of being stuck with yellow.  

length (without lip): 53 mm  
width (without lip): 38 mm  
height (without feet): 41 mm  


# Instructions

PLA, .2mm layer, 10% infill (does not matter as the walls are thin).  

I recommend to print these upside down (except the ones with no compartments), i.e. with the opening on the bottom. The bottom of the bin needs some cleanup afterwards as it will print partially in the air.  

You can print them right upside up, but you will need supports due to the feet. The cleanup of the supports is somewhat difficult but possible with a sharp utility knife (put on some gloves or you'll cut yourself).  

I did experiment with detached feet (to be glued on afterwards), the results were not satisfactory so far. The feet never locate properly and/or the surfaces are not level enough to glue properly.
