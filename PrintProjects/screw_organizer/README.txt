# Summary

The drop in dividers of the Flambeau organizers I purchased did not do a very good job of keeping smaller parts in place, and also made it difficult to retrieve them.  The cups are designed to easily drop into the box and stay in place using the molded grooves.  There are sections of the box where they will not fit (by the handle and corners).  They can easily be removed from the box so you can pull which parts you need for your project.
