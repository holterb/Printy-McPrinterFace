Magnetic cabinet lock Remix - No screws needed, just stick. by Nobel0 is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial license.

# Summary

This is my remix to the Magnetic child lock by bookmake.

This design requires no screws or anything, just  stick it with easily removable double sided tape.

I changed the magnetic sizes to square 10 x 10 x 2 mm. Where the magnet of mag.holder is circular 12 x 3 mm (circular magnet weaker than the square one).

UPDATE:

1. I opened 2nd slot in the base to have different configuration for the mag.holder mounting (Added photo for illustration).
2. The 2nd mag.holder is for the one who has his own magnet, so there is no pocketing (hole) just glue the magnet.

Good Luck
