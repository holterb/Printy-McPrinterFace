# Summary

This thing is a great example of something useful you can do with your printer. It allows you to hang any broom or rake like object using a convenient click in, click out latch. This youtube video shows and example of one in action mounting a rake:

Some of the features of the design:

It prints as one piece using its own parts for support. Where the hinges join, the model is weakened by leaving a blank layer and minimising the contact so that it can be broken free to actuate the hinge. Each hinge is designed to use a metal pin (three needed in total). You can use anything from a screw to a nail to a paperclip of a piece of coat hanger. I have been using nails with 2mm diameter in holes designed to 3mm so they slide in easily. There is an image attached showing a cross section of the hinge holes so you can see how they work.

The base is designed with an inset so that when you print it you can squish the first layer for better bed adhesion without causing a lip around the base of the object. If you have poor bed adhesion and need to use a brim, this obviously wont help, but for me printing PLA on polyimide, it makes for a neat no-cleanup print.

The model is quite customisable to suit a variety of tool diameters or printer setups. As you can see from the photo attached, I have used it for big things like a pool scoop, right down to little things like a pen.

# Example STLs

I have attached some examples, but I encourage you to experiment with the parameters to design the perfect latch for your broom/rake/pen/shafted tool. The two smaller examples don't have screw mounting holes. They are for glue/double sided tape attachment. The 22mm example is similar to the one shown in the linked video.
