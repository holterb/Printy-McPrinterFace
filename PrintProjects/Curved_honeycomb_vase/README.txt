# Summary

Just a couple of modifiers to give Honeycomb vase(by radus) more stable bottom. Also i think it looks more organic. Done in Blender 3d, .blend file is attached.

[**sotvl_Spiral-Vase.stl**] is a solid shape. you should print it in "Spiralize Contour"(Cura) or "Spiral Vase"(Slic3r). Ts is **not** waterproof, as it will be small holes on a way up from bottom. So, it is not good for water, but soil is ok.

[**sotvl_thick** 1,2mm] - with a proper thickness calculation. 1mm and 2mm thick respectfully. probably waterproof... but not tested by myself with a print yet. Slice and print as a usual thing, **not** in vase mode.

[**sotvl_thick-Blender.stl**] is thick/thin shape. should be ok for usual print and waterproof, but need more testing with prints. At current state, it seems it **less reliable** compared to *sotvl_thick_* 1,2mm.

[**sotvl.blend**] - source Blender3d file, shape and thickness can be changed there. (for advanced users)
