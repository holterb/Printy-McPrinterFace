# Summary

After using my Ender 5, I realized there was a lot of space within the frame for tool storage. I designed this caddy to snap onto the 40mm aluminum frame in the left rear. It was originally about 70mm cube but I stretched the forward dimension of this one to about 90mm. The back of the unit is 70mm tall but slopes down to 50mm in the front. The optional insert fits in the rear storage compartment and is designed to hold the Harbor Freight 12pc needle file set without handles. Be careful that taller tools don't lean over into the bed work area. 

I used the Ender 5 tool clip from this link https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3361395
I've found that it is a perfect, snap tight fit. I've used all of his clip designs and recommend them all!

The caddy was designed in sketchup with ~2mm walls and floor. I brought my caddy design and the tool clip together in tinkercad. Sliced in Cura with 20% infill. You can get away with less.....its a VERY strong print. Lay it down flat, like it would sit in reality. 

Update:

Added the needle file insert. Printed the insert lying on its side with support just to ensure the holes printed ok but they may not be needed. .16 resolution on the insert but your favorite settings should work. I did have to file out the holes a tad but it worked out great in the end. Included obj and stl but they are the same piece. 

Update 2:

Added a tall, narrow caddy. This unit is 45mm wide, 100mm long and 80mm tall and was designed to snap onto the front left vertical brace and sits along the left side of the machine. Its just a simple empty box but I am working on inserts to hold various tools, different files and carving tools, etc. Open to ideas. Print this thing standing upright, just like it would sit in use. Tinkercad has some great qualities but it sucks for exporting images of a model. Again, your favorite settings should work, I used the same settings as the other caddy but 15% infill. 

I am still working on this design and currently have a couple of other caddys with different dimensions that snap onto the Ender 5 frame to post soon. Taller, skinnier, longer, you name it. Of course, they work on any 40mm extruded aluminum frame but I am ensuring that they work on Ender 5 without getting in the way of anything. I am very welcome of ideas and suggestions!
