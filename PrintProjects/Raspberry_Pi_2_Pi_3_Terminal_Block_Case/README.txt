# Summary

<p><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:922740">0110-M-P's Raspberry Pi Case</a> is now my goto source as it is designed so perfectly.   This is a modified version of that.</p>

<p>Recently I have been working on an enclosure for my 3D printer and Octoprint.  I have been integrating several different sensors into the Octoprint Raspberry Pi using a terminal block shield which you can get <a href="http://a.co/cbTSqsX">HERE</a>.  This makes things so simple and clean for connecting wires to your Pi.</p>

<p>I will warn you, this is a snug fit.  Typically I design things to slide in effortlessly, but didn't want gaps visible around the terminal blocks; it will slide in though. It is also worth mentioning that I don't know the tolerances on the terminal block boards.  I only purchased one board which the openings was designed around.</p>

<p>The feet and bracket in the picture are not part of this remix.  They are part of  a mounting bracket that allows you to quickly pop on/off anything with a 75mm VESA mount.  You can view that <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2138282">HERE</a>.</p>
