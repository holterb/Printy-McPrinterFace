# Summary

*Requested by Robert S.*

Due to popular demand on the facebook group, I have released this file for **free**.

In return, if you print this and like this model, a **tip of a few bucks** would help me out ***a lot***. Cheers!

If you printed one, be sure to [share](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2335797/add_instance). your make, I'd love to see how it looks!

**NOTE**
If printing "Toothless_With_Supports, do not scale up or down. "Toothless_Without_Supports" is uploaded now as well, in case you would like to scale it and put your own supports on. Happy printing!
