# Summary

Introducing the first design from Parallel Goods.  

This Self-Watering Planter is exactly the growing environment your plants need, while giving you flexibility in your watering routine. It’s super easy to use:  just plant your favorite herb or other water-intensive plant, add water, and you’re all set.  

The Self-Watering Planter was designed to be 3D printed, easy to setup, use and clean; while at the same time allow for customization through mixing and matching different colors for the pot and reservoir. Be sure to check out the Instructions tab to make sure you get the most out this Self-Watering Planter.  

This Self-Watering Planter is part of our 2015 Desk Collection, with more great designs available at [parallelgoods.co](http://parallelgoods.co).

# Print Settings

Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: .3mm
Infill: 10%

Notes: 
This Self-Watering Planter was design to be printed in PLA, and we went through many iterations and lots of experimentation to develop settings which would allow for a water tight print. All of our testing and development was done in PLA to ensure success across a wide variety of printers, without causing too much of an impact to the environment.

**Water Tight PLA Slic3r Settings**  
- Layer Height: .3mm  
- Vertical Shells (Perimeters): 3  
- Horizontal Shells (Solid Layers): Top – 4, Bottom – 4  
- Infill: 10% - Speed: Top Solid Infill – 15mm/s, Solid infill – 15mm/s  
- Prints WITHOUT Supports
  
The extra top & bottom shells combined with the slow solid infill print speeds ensure a thick and even wall for the bottom of the reservoir which provides water tight print. Your mileage may vary, but these settings should give you a fine starting point for use on your own printer.

# Post-Printing

## If you're unable to get a water tight print...

If you're unable to get a water tight print, we recommend coating the bottom of the reservoir in [Titebond-3 Wood Glue](http://amzn.to/2rK7WMO). This particular wood glue is waterproof, but still non-toxic, solvent free, and is FDA approved for indirect food contact (i.e. cutting boards).

## Using your Self-Watering Planter

Set the pot in the reservoir, add your plant of choice, and fill the reservoir to the line inside of the spout. Refill whenever you can’t see any water in the spout. Every few cycles it’s helpful to let the soil dry out to prevent mold from growing inside the pot.
