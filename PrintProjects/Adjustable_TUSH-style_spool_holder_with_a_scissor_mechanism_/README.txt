Adjustable TUSH-style spool holder with a scissor mechanism. by JohnEdwa is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

# Summary

Adjustable between 17mm to ~102mm - should fit pretty much any spool.
      
Requires four 608 bearings and at least four M3 x 8mm button-head bolts, bearing posts should be press-fit with an optional bolt for strength and/or clamping the bearing down.

[Bearing guides can be found here by harlandraka.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2408490)

Fed up with the TUSH always falling over and being fiddly to swap spools with, yet most of the adjustable remixes take too much space, I decided to create one with a scissor mechanism utilizing M3 button head screws as the pivot and sliding points.

The bearing posts have a hole for an M3 bolt and an optional nut for added strength that greatly reduces/removes the risk of delamination.

**Hardware**

   Required:
   4x 608 bearings with [printed guides](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2408490) or flanged bearings.
   4x M3 8mm to button head bolts for the scissor mechanism.

   Optional:
   4x M3 button or countersunk head bolts for the bearing posts. 
4x M3 nuts for clamping the bearing posts.

Included is the Fusion 360 project file as well - it's kinda half-way parametrically modelled so editing should be relatively easy. I'm still inexperienced using it so expect some unorthodox methods and decisions.

---

I guess technically not a remix as I did model everything from the ground up myself, but the visual design is almost directly copied from thing:2086877 so I felt proper to give credit where it's due.
