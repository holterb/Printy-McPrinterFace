# Summary

A unusual magnet for your refrigerator.   
Make it look like it's zipped open with a finger pointing out to a note, you think is important to remember.   
I added a movable zip handle to make it look more dynamic (not really zipping)  

___  
-UPDATE-  

V01.7: One solid mesh and more flat at the bottom. Tested in Cura and Slis3r

# Instructions

___  
Print the magnet-lid STL that is bigger than the diameter measurements (mm) of your magnet.  
The maximum magnet height is 4mm to fit in the magnet-lid.  
After printing you can put your magnet in the lid and glue it in the hole of the zipper on the bottom.  
If you got questions, please leave a comment  
___  
Tip for printing:  
-  
Print the first layers a different color for more contrast in the zipper.
