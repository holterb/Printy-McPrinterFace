# Summary

This caliper holder is designed to snap on to a 20mm extruded aluminum rail. Kilroy01's tool clips work perfectly but he didn't have one that fit the 20mm rail, so I made one. I included a model of just the clip itself, as well, in case someone wants to use it to make their own project. This thing fits snug! 

Update:

Well, I just wasn't happy with the original design...seemed like it wanted to keep tipping towards the thumb wheel and hanging crooked. I added a little shelf to the thumb wheel side to combat that. The only really issue is I had to print with supports from the bed but that's not a huge deal.
